# Machine Learning on AIRBNB data

In this repository we will apply some Machine Learning to an Airbnb dataset of the houses in Madrid. The ML we will apply:

* Bayes
* KNN 
* Decision Trees
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  * Classifier:
    * LinearSVC 
    * LinearSVC with RBF Kernel
  * Regression:
    * LinearSVR
    * LinearSVR with RBF Kernel
